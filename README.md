# Py.tatine's Image Retrieval with Fine-Tuned Models

This repository contains multiple implementations and experimental pipelines for **image retrieval**, specifically developed for a **machine learning competition on image similarity search**.

The goal of the project is to retrieve the **top-10 most visually similar images** from a gallery given a query image. Different deep learning strategies for **fine-tuning convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** have been explored to improve the quality of learned image embeddings.
